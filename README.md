# Crop Production Analysis in India

## Project Overview

This project explores crop production data across Indian states and districts over time. Using Tableau for interactive visualizations and Python for data preparation, the study identifies key trends, high-performing regions, and top-yielding crops. The objective is to uncover insights that can guide agricultural policies and improve farming efficiency.


## Objective

To analyze historical crop production data to:
- Identify top-performing crops and regions.
- Track seasonal and annual production trends.
- Highlight variations in yield across states and crop types.

## Dataset Overview

- **Total records:** 246,091 rows  
- **Columns:** 7 (`State_Name`, `District_Name`, `Crop_Year`, `Season`, `Crop`, `Area`, `Production`)
- **Missing values:** 3,730 null entries in the `Production` column
- **Data period:** 1997 to 2016


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Total Crop Production:** Sum of all recorded crop outputs over time.
- **Crop Yield per Hectare:** Production volume per unit area for each crop.
- **Top Crops by Volume:** Highest producing crops by metric tons.
- **Top Regions by Production:** States and districts with the highest total yields.
- **Seasonal Trends:** Patterns in crop output across Kharif, Rabi, and other seasons.


## Key Insights

- **Top Crops:**  
  - **Coconut:** 129.98B tons  
  - **Sugarcane:** 5.54B tons  
  - **Rice:** 1.61B tons  
  - **Wheat:** 1.33B tons  
  - **Potato:** 424.83M tons

- **Top Producing States:**  
  - **Kerala:** 97.88B tons  
  - **Andhra Pradesh:** 17.32B tons  
  - **Tamil Nadu:** 12.76B tons  
  - **Uttar Pradesh:** 3.23B tons

- **Seasonal Spikes:**  
  - Notable increases in production during 2011 (13.84B tons) and 2013 (12.43B tons)


## Tools & Technologies

- **Data Preparation:** Python, Pandas
- **Visualization:** Tableau
- **Data Format:** CSV


## Visualizations

- Choropleth map of crop production by region and year
- Bar charts for crop yield and top crops by production volume
- Line chart showing seasonal production trends
- Interactive Tableau dashboard


## Conclusion

The analysis reveals regional and seasonal disparities in crop output, with Coconut and Sugarcane dominating production. States like Kerala and Andhra Pradesh lead overall output, highlighting the need for region-specific strategies in agriculture. These insights support data-driven decision-making for policymakers and stakeholders in the farming sector.
